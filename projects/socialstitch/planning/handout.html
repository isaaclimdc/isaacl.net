<span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: Calibri;">15-237 Fall 2012 Homework 
4</span><br style="font-weight: bold; font-family: Calibri;">
<font face="Calibri">Due Sat 6-Oct 11:59pm, early-bird bonus Thu 4-Oct 11:59pm.</font><br style="font-family: Calibri;">
<br style="font-family: Calibri;">
<span style="font-family: Calibri;">Read these instructions first!&nbsp; They 
are similar to hw1, but differ in important ways.&nbsp; Read carefully!</span><p>
<font face="Calibri">This is an open-ended problem to write the client-side of a 
web app that showcases the major concepts we have covered so far in this course.&nbsp; 
The rules are:</font></p>
<ul>
	<li><font face="Calibri">You must not write a game.&nbsp; Anything else is 
	fine, though we recommend something of lasting value (such as, say, an 
	interactive online portfolio that you might provide to prospective 
	employers).</font></li>
	<li><font face="Calibri">Ideally, you will complete this by Thu 4-Oct, but 
	we have extended the deadline to Saturday, though that will shorten your 
	time for hw5.&nbsp; And so you will earn a 5-point early-bird bonus for 
	submitting by Thursday 4-Oct at 11:59pm.</font></li>
	<li><font face="Calibri">You must showcase the major concepts we have 
	covered in weeks 1-4 and then in a natural and compelling way.&nbsp; If your 
	project does not easily allow for this, change your project accordingly, 
	since it is required.&nbsp; That said, you can pick where the focus of your 
	project will be.&nbsp; So if a Canvas does not naturally fit in your 
	original design, don't throw out your design, just add a smart little Canvas 
	object somewhere while preserving the overall design and intent.</font></li>
	<li><font face="Calibri">You should expect to spend 10-15 hours each on this 
	project.&nbsp; Some students invested far more than that on hw1 (our last 
	open-ended project).&nbsp; You may do so, but we do not expect that, and it 
	is not required, as we expect 10-15 hours to be just fine to accomplish 
	everything required to obtain a solid A on this project.</font></li>
	<li><font face="Calibri">Projects should show a level of sophistication in 
	keeping with 10-15 hours of effort given how much you should already know 
	after completing hw1-3.&nbsp; They should be neither too simplistic nor too 
	complex.&nbsp; They should also be <i>interesting</i>, though we will take a 
	broad view of this.</font></li>
	<li><font face="Calibri">Your code does not have to run on mobile devices, 
	but it must run on both Chrome and Firefox on a desktop. Be sure to test it 
	on both.&nbsp; That said, </font>if you would like to use an API that is 
	only available in one of Firefox or Chrome, make sure your web app still 
	shows some useful information in a nice, user-friendly way on the other 
	browser (for example, maybe it informs users that they will get the full 
	experience only on browser X).</li>
	<li><font face="Calibri">We encourage you to work in 2-to-3-person groups, 
	but you may request to work alone if you wish.&nbsp; All such requests 
	should be made by email to the instructor no later than Sunday 23-Sep.</font></li>
	<li><font face="Calibri">Each group 
	will make a single submission. Do not just split the work among you and 
	merge it at the end. You are also responsible for thoroughly understanding 
	every single line of code your group submits.</font></li>
	<li><font face="Calibri">You may not use any server-side computation for 
	this project, except for publicly-available web services that you did not 
	write.&nbsp; That is, you need to write an AJAX client, but only consuming 
	pre-existing services.&nbsp; Otherwise, your project must work when served 
	by a server that only supports static HTML pages (that is, again, no 
	server-side computation).</font></li>
	<li><font face="Calibri">Besides this server-side restriction, you may use 
	any 3rd-party libraries or tools that you wish.&nbsp; That said, there must 
	not be any installation procedure of any kind for your project.&nbsp; To 
	grade your project, we will load the top-level HTML file (preferably 
	index.html), and that's it.</font></li>
	<li><font face="Calibri">You must create an entirely new piece of work, and 
	not reuse anything you have written before this course.&nbsp; You may extend 
	work that you submitted earlier in this course, but you will only be graded 
	on the new contributions, which must be clearly marked.</font></li>
	<li><font face="Calibri">Have fun. Truly!!!</font></li>
</ul>
<p><font face="Calibri">What to submit? A single zip file containing…</font></p>
<ul>
	<li><font face="Calibri">Your html and js file</font></li>
	<li><font face="Calibri">A comment at the head of your js file including all 
	your group members’ names and andrew id’s</font></li>
	<li><font face="Calibri">A readme file also including your group members’ 
	names and andrew id’s, as well as a brief description of what your project 
	is and how to operate or use it.</font></li>
	<li><font face="Calibri">A grading-help file also including your group 
	members’ names and andrew id’s, as well as a list of each of the &quot;required 
	elements&quot; in the rubric (see below) and briefly explaining how you satisfied 
	that element, as well as how the TA/grader can easily confirm this (both by 
	inspecting your code and visually by running your web app).&nbsp; Be brief 
	but precise, including line numbers in your HTML/CSS/JS as appropriate.</font></li>
</ul>
<p><font face="Calibri">How to submit?</font></p>
<ul>
	<li><font face="Calibri">Be certain that your readme file contains the names 
	and andrew id's of all your group members, or else they will not get credit!</font></li>
	<li><font face="Calibri">Only the group member with the first andrew id 
	alphabetically should submit this zip file to Autolab by the hw deadline.</font></li>
</ul>
<p><font face="Calibri">What to do if a group member does not pull their weight?</font></p>
<ul>
	<li><font face="Calibri">Just let me know. But let’s not have this happen.</font></li>
</ul>
<p><font face="Calibri">How will you be graded?<br>
<br>
The grading is naturally a bit subjective on such an open-ended and creative 
project, but we try very hard to be reasonable and predictable and to maintain 
consistency and fairness across all submissions.&nbsp; Here is an outline of the 
rubric:</font></p>
<ol>
	<li><font face="Calibri"><b>Required Elements [35 pts; 5 pts each]<br>
	</b>Your project must demonstrate clear and effective use of each of the 
	following major concepts we have covered:</font><ol>
		<li><font face="Calibri">Javascript (including creating your own objects 
		with inheritance)</font></li>
		<li><font face="Calibri">Canvas (somehow this must be included 
		meaningfully)</font></li>
		<li><font face="Calibri">HTML (including a reasonably wide range of 
		techniques, such as tables, forms with form validation, etc)</font></li>
		<li><font face="Calibri">CSS (including a reasonably range of 
		techniques, such as reset, pseudo-selectors, fixed 
		and fluid layout, transitions and animations, etc)</font></li>
		<li><font face="Calibri">DOM manipulation</font></li>
		<li><font face="Calibri">AJAX and/or JSON-P client</font></li>
		<li><font face="Calibri">jQuery<b><br>
&nbsp;</b></font></li>
	</ol>
	</li>
	<li><font face="Calibri"><b>Robust App [20 pts]<br>
	</b>Your web app should work.&nbsp; It should load and run with no exceptions, 
	and clearly perform some easily-understood task, and it should perform it 
	properly under normal usage.&nbsp; It also should not crash or hang or 
	otherwise enter some error state, even in the face of undesired input.<b><br>
	&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;</font></li>
	<li><font face="Calibri"><b>User Interface Design [20 pts]<br>
	</b>You should have a reasonably polished user interface with a clean, 
	pleasing visual design, and with intuitive controls and navigation.<b><br>
	&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;</font></li>
	<li><font face="Calibri"><b>Effort [20 pts]<br>
	</b>Once again:&nbsp; you are expected to invest at least 10-15 hours into this 
	project, and it is further expected that your project will clearly reflect 
	the quantity and quality of design and craftsmanship that goes along with 
	that much time on this task.<br>
	&nbsp;</font></li>
	<li><b><font face="Calibri">Code </font></b><font face="Calibri"><b>Design / 
	Style [5 pts]<br>
	</b>Your project should be divided properly into HTML, CSS, and JS, with 
	clear designs in each.&nbsp; Your code should abide by all the style 
	guidelines we have discussed in this course.<br>
	&nbsp;<b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</b></font></li>
	<li><font face="Calibri"><b>Bonus [0 to 10+ pts]<br>
	</b>For extraordinary work, we may award bonus points.&nbsp;&nbsp; Please discuss more 
	ambitious bonus attempts with the TA's or the instructor prior to investing 
	too much time into them!</font></li>
</ol>
<p><font face="Calibri">Enjoy!!!</font></p>
